# Analysis-of-US-economic-data
Here in this repository we are going to do something which is very interesting.
Analysis of US economic data gives us the result of how the economy has performed in a particular year.
A Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this lab, you will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate. You will take screen shots of every step, you will share the notebook and the URL pointing to the dashboard.
